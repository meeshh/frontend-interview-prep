### What does an Interpreted Language mean?

JavaScript is an interpreted language rather than a compiled one. The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they are executed and translated into machine code:

1. **Interpreted Languages**:
    
    - Interpreted languages are executed line by line, directly by an interpreter program.
    - The source code is translated into machine code and executed on-the-fly, without the need for a separate compilation step.
    - Each time the program is run, the interpreter reads the source code, translates it into machine code, and executes it.
    - Examples of interpreted languages include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
2. **Compiled Languages**:
    
    - Compiled languages, on the other hand, undergo a separate compilation step before execution.
    - The source code is translated into machine code or bytecode by a compiler, producing an executable file or intermediate representation.
    - This compiled code can then be executed directly by the computer's processor without further translation.
    - Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Java (which is compiled to bytecode then interpreted or compiled at runtime by the Java Virtual Machine), and Swift.

**Key differences**:

- **Performance**: Compiled languages often have better performance because the compilation process allows for extensive optimization. Interpreted languages typically have slower performance as they translate code at runtime.
    
- **Portability**: Interpreted languages are generally more portable since they only require the interpreter to run, making them easier to distribute and execute across different platforms. Compiled languages may require specific compilers for each target platform.
    
- **Development and Debugging**: Interpreted languages usually offer quicker development cycles since changes to the source code are immediately reflected in the execution. Compiled languages may have longer compile times, especially for large projects, but they may catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
    

JavaScript's interpretation happens within the browser or runtime environment. Modern JavaScript engines, like V8 in Chrome or SpiderMonkey in Firefox, use sophisticated techniques such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimizations to improve performance, blurring the line between traditional interpreted and compiled languages. However, fundamentally, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language due to its execution model.

### What is JavaScript Generator?

it is a special type of function that can pause its execution while keeping its context. This allows for the generation of a sequence of values over time, which can be iterated over asynchronously using the `yield` keyword

#### Example

```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = numberGenerator();

console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

```

In this example, `numberGenerator` is a generator function that yields three values (`1`, `2`, and `3`). When you call `next()` on the generator object returned by `numberGenerator()`, it returns an object with the `value` property containing the yielded value and the `done` property indicating whether the generator has finished executing.

Generators are useful for scenarios where you need to iterate over a potentially large sequence of values without loading them all into memory at once, or when you need to represent asynchronous operations as a sequence of steps. They are commonly used in asynchronous programming with JavaScript, for example with asynchronous iteration using `for await...of` loops or in combination with Promises.

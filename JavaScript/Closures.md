### What are JavaScript Closures

In JavaScript, closures are a fundamental concept that allows functions to retain access to variables from their containing lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures occur when a function is defined within another function and has access to the outer function's variables.

Here's a basic example to illustrate closures:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am from outerFunction';
  
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
  }
  
  return innerFunction;
}

const innerFunc = outerFunction();
innerFunc(); // Output: "I am from outerFunction"
```

In this example:

- `outerFunction` defines a local variable `outerVariable` and a nested function `innerFunction`.
- `innerFunction` is enclosed within `outerFunction`, creating a closure. It retains access to `outerVariable` even after `outerFunction` has finished executing.
- When `innerFunc` is called outside of `outerFunction`, it still has access to `outerVariable` and can log its value.

Closures are powerful because they enable functions to "remember" the environment in which they were created, allowing for encapsulation and the creation of private variables and functions.

Common use cases for closures include:

1. **Data Privacy**: Encapsulating variables within a closure allows you to create private variables and functions that are inaccessible from outside the closure, ensuring data privacy and preventing unintended modifications.
    
2. **Function Factories**: Closures can be used to create functions dynamically with pre-configured parameters or behaviors, commonly known as function factories.
    
3. **Callback Functions**: Closures are often used to maintain state or context in callback functions, ensuring that the callback has access to the necessary data even when it's executed asynchronously.
    
4. **Memoization**: Closures can be used to implement memoization, a technique used to cache the results of expensive function calls to improve performance.
    

Understanding closures is crucial for writing clean, modular, and maintainable JavaScript code, as they play a significant role in many advanced programming patterns and techniques.

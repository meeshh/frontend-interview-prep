### What is SSR (Server Side Rendering)

SSR stands for Server-Side Rendering. It's a technique used in web development where the server generates the HTML of a web page dynamically and sends it to the client's browser. This means that when a user requests a web page, instead of receiving just a barebones HTML shell and having to wait for JavaScript to load and render the content on the client-side, the server processes the request, fetches the necessary data, renders the HTML, and sends a fully formed HTML response back to the client.

Here's how SSR typically works:

1. **Client Request**: A user requests a web page from the server by entering a URL or clicking a link.
2. **Server-Side Processing**: The server receives the request and dynamically generates the HTML for the requested page. This may involve fetching data from a database, calling external APIs, or performing any other necessary server-side logic.
3. **HTML Response**: Once the HTML is generated, the server sends the complete HTML response back to the client's browser.
4. **Client-Side Rendering (Optional)**: Once the initial HTML is received, the client's browser can start rendering and displaying the content immediately. If there are any JavaScript frameworks or libraries used in the application, they can be loaded and executed to enhance interactivity and functionality.

SSR offers several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**: SSR can improve the perceived performance of a web application by sending the initial HTML quickly to the client, allowing users to see content sooner, especially on slower connections or less powerful devices.
2. **[SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](../General/SEO.md)**: Search engines can more easily crawl and index content that is rendered on the server-side, which can improve the website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages.
3. **Accessibility**: SSR can help ensure that web pages are accessible to users who have JavaScript disabled or use assistive technologies, as the basic content is available even without JavaScript.
4. **Social Sharing**: Social media platforms often rely on scraping HTML content when generating previews for shared links. SSR ensures that the correct content is available for sharing, leading to better previews and engagement on social media.

However, SSR may also introduce some challenges, such as increased server load, complexity in managing server-side rendering logic, and potential issues with client-side hydration (the process of attaching event handlers and reactivating components on the client-side). Overall, SSR is a powerful technique that can be beneficial for certain types of web applications, particularly those that prioritize performance, [SEO](../General/SEO.md), and accessibility.

### What is NextJS?

Next.js is an open-source React framework that enables developers to build server-side rendered (SSR) or statically generated web applications. It's often used for building modern web applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, and routing.

Here are some key features and concepts of Next.js:

1. Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client, which can improve performance and SEO.
2. Static site generation (SSG): Next.js can generate static HTML files at build time for improved performance and SEO. This feature is useful for content-heavy websites that don't require real-time data.
3. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks, so only the necessary code is loaded when navigating between pages, improving load times.
4. Routing: Next.js provides a file-based routing system, where each React component in the pages directory corresponds to a route in the application. This simplifies the process of defining routes and handling navigation.
5. API routes: Next.js allows you to create API routes within your application, enabling you to handle server-side logic and data fetching directly from your Next.js server.
6. TypeScript support: Next.js has built-in support for TypeScript, making it easy to write type-safe React applications.
7. CSS-in-JS support: Next.js supports various CSS-in-JS solutions, such as styled-components and CSS modules, enabling you to style your components directly within your JavaScript code.
8. Developer experience: Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like hot module replacement (HMR), fast refresh, and built-in support for popular tools like ESLint and Prettier.

Overall, Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications with features that enhance performance, SEO, and developer productivity. It's widely used in the React ecosystem for building both small and large-scale web applications.
